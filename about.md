# About

<!--author-->

I study the ecology and evolution of acoustic communication. I strive to understand how the biotic and abiotic environment affect acoustic signaling in animals. I am particularly interested in the dynamics of acoustic communities and the effect of social interactions on acoustic signals. I am currently conducting two main lines of research: developing methods of passive acoustic monitoring in various environments and in particular in freshwater environments and understanding the role of socially mediated plasticity in rapid adaptation and reproductive isolation.

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow in [Wilfried Thuiller's](http://www.will.chez-alice.fr/About_me.html) team at the Université Grenoble Alpes where I am setting up a network of acoustic recorders along elevational gradients in the Alps and the Pyrenees to monitor mountain environments.

I was previously a post-doctoral fellow between [Rafael Rodriguez's lab](http://www.preferencefunctions.org) and [Nathan Bailey's lab](http://www.flexiblephenotype.org/) where I studied the effect of social environment on mate choice in insects that communicate with substrate-borne vibrations.

Before that, I was a post-doctoral fellow working with [Diego Llusia](https://www.uam.es/Ciencias/Llusia-Genique,-Diego/1446738942604.htm?language=es&pid=1242665012287&title=Llusia%20Genique,%20Diego) in the [Departamento de Ecología](https://www.uam.es/Ciencias/Departamento-de-Ecologia/1242664090207.htm?language=es&nodepath=Departamento%20de%20Ecolog?a) ([Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](https://www.uam.es/UAM/Home.htm?language=es)) where I studied the effect of climate change on frogs.

I did my PhD on the acoustic diversity and ecology of freshwater environments supervised by [Fanny Rybak](http://www.cb.u-psud.fr/Fanny.htm) and [Jérôme Sueur](http://isyeb.mnhn.fr/annuaire-et-pages-personnelles/pages-personnelles/article/sueur-jerome). 

You can find my — somewhat up to date — CV [here](/assets/img/CVen.pdf).


I am happy to collaborate on any project related to ecology, diversity and evolution of acoustic communication. You can reach me at [cdesjonqu@gmail.com](mailto:cdesjonqu@gmail.com).
