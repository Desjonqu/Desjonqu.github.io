I wrote a [review](/assets/img/Desjonqueres_2018_Ecoacoustics.pdf) of the ground breaking book "Ecoacoustics: The Ecological Role of Sounds" for the Quarterly Review of Biology. Check it out, but more importantly, read the [book](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Ecoacoustics%3A+The+Ecological+Role+of+Sounds-p-9781119230694)!!
