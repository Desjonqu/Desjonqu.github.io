[Larissa Sayuri Moreira Sugai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Larissa_Sugai2) and colleagues just published a great [review](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/69/1/15/5193506?redirectedFrom=fulltext) on terrestrial passive acoustic monitoring in [Bioscience](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/). On this occasion, terrestrial PAM is featured on the cover of the journal with me as a unexpected subject of [Diego Llusia](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Diego_Llusia)'s beautiful picture.
