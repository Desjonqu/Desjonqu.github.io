Carlos Abrahams, Jack Greenhalgh and I just published a new [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.7585) in *Ecology & Evolution*. We propose a new sampling scheme to collect simple pond acoustic samples in a comparable way between studies. This scheme is designed to be as open and collaborative as possible. Data collected with this scheme can be uploaded to the PASS [Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/pass?page=1&size=20). This community allows access to standard pond samples that can then be used for scientific research, education or artistic purposes. We hope this will allow to widen the spatial spread of pond acoustic studies.
