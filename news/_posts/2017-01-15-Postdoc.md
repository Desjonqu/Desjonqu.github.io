I have just started a new position at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in [Rafael Rodriguez's](http://www.preferencefunctions.org) lab. I will be looking for components of language in insect communication. I will be working here for two years, supported by a fellowship from [Fondation Fyssen](http://www.fondationfyssen.fr/en/).
