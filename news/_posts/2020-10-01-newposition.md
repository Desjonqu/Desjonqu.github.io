I just finished my contract at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with [Rafa Rodr√≠guez's lab](http://preferencefunctions.org/), and, as of today, I'm starting a new position at the University of St Andrews in [Nathan Bailey's lab](http://www.flexiblephenotype.org/). I'm excited to continue working on social plasticity and signal divergence from a theoretical point of view this time.
