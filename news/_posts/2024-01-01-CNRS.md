Happy new year! Today is my first day as a [CNRS] permanent researcher (charg√©e de recherche) at the [Laboratoire d'Ecologie Alpine](https://leca.osug.fr/). I am so excited to finally settle down for a bit and for the new opportunities here in Grenoble. I'm looking forward to welcoming colleagues for exciting new work on ecoacoustics in the Alps or elsewhere !
