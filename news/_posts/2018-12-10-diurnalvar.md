Our [paper](/assets/img/Linke_et_al_2018_Diurnal_variation_in_freshwater_ecoacoustics.pdf) on the implications of diurnal variation for freshwater acoustic monitoring was just published online in *Freshwater Biology*. This research reveals that due to important temporal heterogeneity, the most efficient and comprehensive way to sample acoustic diversity is by sampling short snippets at various times over 24 hours. Here is a picture of our field work for this project and a nice interview of the lead author, Simon Linke, presenting our research on the Australian radio.
