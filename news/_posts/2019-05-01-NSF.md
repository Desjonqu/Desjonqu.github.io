[Rafa Rodr√≠guez](http://www.preferencefunctions.org) and I, in collaboration with [Nathan Bailey](http://www.flexiblephenotype.org) received NSF funding to work on the project "Speciation and social plasticity: signal-preference phenotypes in social and genetic hybrids". I'm looking forward to start this project during which we will create treehopper social hybrids and explore potential effects of social plasticity on evolution.
