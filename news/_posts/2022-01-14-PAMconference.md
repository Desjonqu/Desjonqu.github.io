We are pleased to invite you to the event “Applying Passive Acoustic Monitoring: current practices and future solutions", organized by the Université Toulouse III – Paul Sabatier and the CeDInt-UPM in the framework of the [Tr@nsnet](https://www.irit.fr/TRANSNET/en/home/) Interreg Sudoe Project.

Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is an emerging tool allowing to survey animal populations, communities, and ecosystems. As for any new tool, it requires research to understand the scope of applications and design appropriate sampling and analysis methods. From data collection to ecological assessment, there are several steps that require attention including:

- Sampling design
- Hardware
- Signal processing/software

This workshop will introduce current practices in PAM and invite an interdisciplinary panel of researchers to brainstorm future solutions.
