I am glad to announce that our [paper](/assets/img/Linke_et_al-2018-Frontiers_in_Ecology_and_the_Environment.pdf) entitled "Freshwater ecoacoustics as a tool for continuous ecosystem monitoring" was just accepted for publication in *Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution*. This paper presents the great perspectives of acoustics for freshwater monitoring.
