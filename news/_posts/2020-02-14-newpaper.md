Our [new paper](/assets/img/Greenhalgh_et_al_2020_The_role_of_freshwater_bioacoustics_in_ecological.pdf) entitled **The role of freshwater bioacoustics in ecological research** just came out in *WIREs Water*! We review hundreds of articles and highlight research needs for the future of Freshwater Ecoacoustics. We show a shift from organism studies to more holistic approaches  such as soundscape studies. We also identify arthropod research as an important future avenue for freshwater ecoacoustics. 

Congratulations to Jack on his first PhD paper!
