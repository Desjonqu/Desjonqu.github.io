Our [special issue](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/13652427/2020/65/1) entitled **Passive acoustics: a new addition to the freshwater monitoring toolbox** just came out this month in *Freshwater Biology*! This issue contains 15 articles written by 49 contributors from 26 institutions around the world. We edited this exciting issue with Simon Linke and Toby Gifford and provided an [editorial](/assets/img/Linke_et_al_2020_Six_steps_towards_operationalising_freshwater.pdf) about the main challenges facing freshwater ecoacoustics now.

Here is a [short article](https://news.griffith.edu.au/2020/01/22/fish-shazam-acoustic-monitoring-a-window-into-health-of-waterways/) about this special issue (and below, Simon enjoying this beautiful and sound-filled river in Talaroo).
