Our [paper](/assets/img/Linke_et_al-2018-Frontiers_in_Ecology_and_the_Environment.pdf) entitled "Freshwater ecoacoustics as a tool for continuous ecosystem monitoring" was just published in *Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution*. This paper presents the great perspectives of acoustics for freshwater monitoring. You can find an interview of Simon Linke presenting our research [here](https://au.news.yahoo.com/video/watch/39534850/queensland-researchers-listening-to-talking-fish/).
