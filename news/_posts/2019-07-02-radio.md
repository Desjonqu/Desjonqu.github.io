Some of my PhD research was featured on a [radio show](https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/le-temps-d-un-bivouac/le-temps-d-un-bivouac-02-juillet-2019) on France inter (French radio, so it's in French). Hugo Struna from Vigie Nature talked about some of the coolest sounds I had the opportunity of recording. The pond sounds are at 38 minutes.
