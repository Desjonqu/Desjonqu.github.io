Today I took part in my first ever twitter conference: #TropiCon. I presented the project we are developing with [Diego Llusia](https://www.uam.es/Ciencias/Llusia-Genique,-Diego/1446738942604.htm?language=es&pid=1242665012287&title=Llusia%20Genique,%20Diego) and [Sara Villén-Pérez](https://saravillenperez.wixsite.com/villenperez) about the ecoacoustic approach to species distribution modeling. 

Although there's nothing like in person scientific exchanges, I really enjoyed the experience and felt like I had the opportunity to reach more people than with a typical conference. 

Here is the [thread](https://twitter.com/Desjonq/status/1324369633219063810?s=20) that I published.
