The crazy underwater acoustic team (Chris Karaconstantis, Toby Gifford, Simon Linke and I) just published a new [article](/assets/img/Karaconstantis_et_al_2020_micro-_and_macro-variation_in_a_chain_of.pdf) on freshwater sounds. We find that within a site, single hydrophones can characterise soundscapes perfectly. Variation between adjacent sites is slightly higher, but diel change in river sounds needs to be accounted for!
