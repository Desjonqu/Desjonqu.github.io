Our new [paper](/assets/img/Desjonqueres_et_al_2022_Acoustic_species_distribution_models.pdf) describing a methodological framework to build SDMs with acoustic data is out in *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*. In this paper with Sara Villén-Pérez, Paulo de Marco, Juan Beltrán, Rafael Márquez, and Diego Llusia, we details the steps to build aSDMs, use the Iberian tree frog to showcase this method and compare aSDMs with correlative and mechanistic SDMs. The code to build these aSDMs is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Desjonqu/aSDMs).
