I will be a collaborator on [Simon Linke](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon_Linke)'s explorer grant. The aim of this project is to characterise the sounds of Australian fish using hydrophone and video recordings. This exciting project will take place on the land of the Ewamian people in Talaroo (Queensland).
