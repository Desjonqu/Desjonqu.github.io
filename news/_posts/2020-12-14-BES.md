I attended the [Festival of Ecology](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/events/festival-of-ecology/) organized by the British Ecological society. I presented my research on freshwater acoustic monitoring in the session organized by [Sam Ross](https://srpjr.wordpress.com/) and [Darren O'Connell](https://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/postgraduate/current-students/darren.php). I also did a twitter take-over for the [Method in Ecology and Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210x)'s account. What a fun virtual meeting, I learned and thought a lot!!
