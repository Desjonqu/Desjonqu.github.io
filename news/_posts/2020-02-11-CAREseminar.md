I presented the research I have been doing on freshwater ecoacoustics as a webinar for the environmental acoustics seminar series of the Center for Acoustic Research and Education at University of New Hampshire. 

If you love cool science and research about animal sounds, you should check out the [program](https://eos.unh.edu/center-acoustics-research-education/outreach/environmental-acoustics-seminar-series) of this seminar series and if you scroll down you can rewatch past seminars.
