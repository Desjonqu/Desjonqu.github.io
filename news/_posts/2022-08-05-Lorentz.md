This is the end of a fantastic five [day workshop](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/full-stack-bioacoustics-field-kit-to-ai-to-action.html) in Leiden. All day discussing how to use, deploy, and analyse passive acoustic monitoring. I met some wonderful people during the week! It's always great to put a face on the authors of your favorite publications. It's also good to be back at an in person event! Thanks to the four great organizers: Dan Stowell, Caitlin Black, Florencia Noriega and Sarab Sethi. I come back to the lab inspired and energized.
