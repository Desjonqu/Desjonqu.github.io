I went to the [ESEB conference](https://www.eseb2022.cz/) in Prague. An intense conference of over 1500 participants. I listened to some fantastic speakers. Nathan Bailey and I organized a symposium on the role of plasticity in Evolution. We ended with a 45 minute discussion (and people were still going on after the 45 minutes). Thanks to all the presenters in our session! I also presented my own research on how social plasticity enhances signal and preference divergence in the session "The evolution of behavioural adaptations" organized by Philipp Brand, Mingzi Xu, Richard Merrill.
