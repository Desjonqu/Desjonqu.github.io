Jak Maliszewski, Rafa Rodr√≠guez and I just published a new [paper](/assets/img/Desjonqueres_et_al_2021_Juvenile_social_experience_and_practice_have_a.pdf) in Evolution. We looked at what aspects of social inputs matter during development. We found an effect of experience of other individual signals and signalling practice as juvenile on the preferences of adults females. In both cases, we do not detect gradual effects but some vs none effects. Switch-like and gradual effects are likely to have different evolutionary outcomes. We need to better understand of how socially plastic traits develop and result in phenotypic variation.
