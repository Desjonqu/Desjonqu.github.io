I was just visiting [Sabrina Michael](https://cocroft.biology.missouri.edu/people/sabrina-michael/) and [Rex Cocroft](https://cocroft.biology.missouri.edu) at the University of Missouri. I learned how to make my own super cheap yet efficient vibration sensors!! Thanks Rex and Sabrina for sharing your knowledge!!
