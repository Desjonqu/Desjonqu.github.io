I just finished my contract at the university autonomous of Madrid with Diego Llusia, and, as of today, I'm starting a new position at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in [Rafa Rodr√≠guez's lab](http://preferencefunctions.org/). I'm excited to be back to work on treehoppers and start a new project about social plasticity and signal divergence.
