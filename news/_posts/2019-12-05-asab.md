This week I had the opportunity to share my research and attend the [2019 ASAB winter meeting](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23asabwinter2019&src=typeahead_click). This edition was focused on social environment and behavioral plasticity. Thanks to this conference I have met amazing researchers in the field and reaffirmed my passion for the evolutionary consequences of socially mediated plasticity. I'm really excited to get to investigate these burning questions next!
