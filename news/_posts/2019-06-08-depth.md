The secret sound of ponds, part of [Depth](https://detroit.sciencegallery.com/depth?fbclid=IwAR2q3QWm_LpnL5QvDuOoY2W1eM76UL1fgPQUG2kqJhZ0Lq-pvFGr0UAtXcU) exhibition opened this Saturday. This immersive piece features a composition by the musician [David Rottenberg](http://www.davidrothenberg.net) with sounds that I have recorded in French ponds and rivers as well as a visual installation by [Ben Gottesman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin_Gottesman) and Casey Synesael. It is free at the Michigan Science Gallery in Detroit.

A video of the piece is available [here](https://youtu.be/aeJBMbhLRoA?t=154) and the composition by David is available [here](https://soundcloud.com/david-rothenberg-530981395/the-secret-sounds-of-ponds?fbclid=IwAR1FvR0pwSkBjapFIxLMGml8maTqFa1hGFqWEeqRj2u3Vxdrx4A7xmraef0)
