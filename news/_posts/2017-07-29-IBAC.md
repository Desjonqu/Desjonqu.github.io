I will be attending the [International Bioacoustic Congress](http://www.ibac2017india.com) in Haridwar, India in october 2017! I will give a presentation on my first postdoc results during "Dynamic Signaling in a Dynamic World" symposium organised by Sue Anne Zollinger and Masayo F. SOMA. I will also have a poster on my PhD work! See you there.
