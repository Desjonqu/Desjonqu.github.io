I'm very excited to be part of the *Methods in Ecology and Evolution* [editorial board](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/2041210X/editorial-board/editorial-board) for the next three years. I'm one of [30 new associate editors](https://methodsblog.com/2020/11/06/announcing-our-new-associate-editors-2020/) recruited this year on various fields of ecology and evolution. Looking forward to handling articles on passive acoustic monitoring and any other exciting topics!
