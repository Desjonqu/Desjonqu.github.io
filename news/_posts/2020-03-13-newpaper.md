Our [new paper](/assets/img/van_der_Lee_et_al_2020_Freshwater_ecoacoustics.pdf) entitled **Freshwater ecoacoustics: Listening to the ecological status of multi-stressed lowland waters** just came out in *Ecological Indicators*! In this paper, we demonstrate that the underwater soundscape of ditches strongly correlates with oxygen dynamics. We suggest that this correlation could be used to estimate ditch metabolism. This work stems from a very happy collaboration between [Gea van der Lee](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/e/g.h.vanderlee/g.h.van-der-lee.html?1555934711885&1584300075337), her PhD advisers ([Piet Verdonschot](https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Piet-prof.dr.ir.-PFM-Piet-Verdonschot.htm) and [Michiel Kraak](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/k/r/m.h.s.kraak/m.h.s.kraak.html)), my PhD adviser ([Jérôme Sueur](http://ear.cnrs.fr)) and me. It was initiated when Gea and I met at the SFS conference in 2018. Conferences can be great places to talk about crazy ideas and start fun new projects!
