We are launching the first #PASSDAY21! 

You want to contribute to a collaborative project aiming towards a better understanding of pond soundscapes? On June 21st go to your local pond, get your hydrophone out and record the #freshwater #soundscape!

A wide variety of organisms produce sounds underwater in ponds, frogs, insects, fish and even plants! Most people have a pond near their homes, and yet we currently know very little about the sounds found in those environments and the factors influencing them.

- *Who?* You (basically anyone who owns a hydrophone!)
- *What?* Your hydrophone and recorder
- *Where?* Your local pond, anywhere in the world 
- *When?* June 21st anytime of the day or night
- *Why?* To contribute to a cool collaborative project, to hear surprisingly diverse soundscapes, to express your love of ponds, to listen to something different on worldmusicdayâ€¦

**To participate, four simple steps:**

1. go out to a pond 
2. record 10 microhabitats for one minute each
3. take note of metadata using the field data form: https://zenodo.org/record/3954853/files/SI2_PASS_surveyor_yyyymmdd_hhmmss_location.csv?download=1
4. upload your recordings and metadata to Zenodo: https://tinyurl.com/3e3d7yv4


[PASS](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.7585) is a new sampling scheme to collect rapid standardised acoustic samples in small waterbodies that we (Carlos Abrahams, Jack Greenhalgh and I) published recently. You can use for independent studies and/or upload your data on Zenodo to help generate an open database of worldwide pond soundscapes for scientific, educational or artistic purposes.

Get in touch with us at [pondacoustics@gmail.com](mailto:pondacoustics@gmail.com) if you are interested in contributing, if you have any questions or if you want to share the coolest sounds you have ever heard in a pond. We hope to hear your #PASSDAY21 recording!
