I have just arrived at the [CEREEP](https://www.cereep.bio.ens.psl.eu/) to run an experiment with Emilie Rojas, Vincent MÃ©doc, Simon Agostini, Vincent Felten and Michael Danger on the sounds of organic matter decomposition. My stay is supported by a transnational access of [AQUACOSM PLUS](https://www.aquacosm.eu/) Looking forwards to the results of this exciting project!
