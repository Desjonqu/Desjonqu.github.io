I'm excited to officially be back in France for a postdoc at the [Laboratoire d'Écologie Alpine](https://leca.osug.fr/) with [Wilfried Thuiller](http://www.will.chez-alice.fr/About_me.html). I'm getting my ears out of the water as we are setting up a Passive Acoustic Monitoring program within the altitudinal gradients of the [Orchamp](https://orchamp.osug.fr/) ecological observatory. Stay tuned for some cool mountain sounds!
