[Larissa Sugai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Larissa_Sugai2), [Thiago Silva](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thiago_Silva5), [Diego Llusia](https://www.uam.es/Ciencias/Llusia-Genique,-Diego/1446738942604.htm?language=es&pid=1242665012287&title=Llusia%20Genique,%20Diego) and I published a new paper in *Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation* about designs of Passive Acoustic Monitoring. This [paper](/assets/img/Sugai_et_al_2019_A_roadmap_for_survey_designs_in_terrestrial.pdf) reviews what has been done so far in terms of spatial and temporal designs for terrestrial PAM and provides a roadmap to navigate this emerging field. I'm very excited for this first paper coming out of my second post-doc!
